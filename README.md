# Ponds_and_wells_detection

This project detects wells and ponds (dry and wet) within a specified geographic region using satellite imagery tiles and a YOLO-based object detection model. It processes images, extracts polygons of detected ponds, filters based on entropy (for wet ponds), converts pixel coordinates to geospatial coordinates, and generates a combined shapefile of all detected ponds.
